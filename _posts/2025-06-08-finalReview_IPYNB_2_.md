# Eric Yu – Portfolio

### High School Junior | Cybersecurity · Machine Learning · Backend Development

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a high school junior with a passion for **cybersecurity**, **computer science**, and **machine learning**. I enjoy working on personal projects—especially those involving machine learning—where I’ve experimented with combining conventional models and large language model (LLM) enhancements.

I focus heavily on backend development. Through my projects, I’ve sharpened my **Java skills**, deepened my **understanding of databases**, and significantly improved my **debugging abilities**.

---

## 💾 Project Overview

I work in the `Database/UI` group, which manages both the backend database and the user interface of our website. My primary contribution has been a **database backup management system** that allows the class to **backup and restore** the database—critical for safe schema upgrades that require a full reset.

### 📊 Grade Analytics (Before December – December)

Initially, I joined the `Assignments` group and helped debug assignment creation. I eventually became responsible for developing a **Grade Analytics** feature.

- Created backend API endpoints to compute summary statistics
- Built the frontend to display these stats as graphs

### 🗄️ Database Backups (December – Now)

A critical feature in the Database/UI team, this tool allows full **backup and restoration** of our SQLite database:

- Developed the **backend API** independently
- Designed and built most of the **frontend UI** (integrated into ThymeLeaf by a teammate)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (May)

Fixed a longstanding issue requiring database deletion after each server run:

- Created a script to toggle auto-DDL from `"update"` to `"none"` as needed

## 🧠 Data Structures Certification & Academic Excellence

### ✅ Certification Achievement

Over six months of working on the database system, I’ve gained a **complex understanding** of relational data structures and SQLite operations.

- **Advanced SQLite Knowledge**:
  - Example: WAL mode, delayed transactions, schema upgrades
- **Comprehensive Table Understanding**:
  - Worked with **all class-wide server tables**

## 🎤 Project Showcasing Experience

### Night at the Museum (N@tM) – June 2025

An amazing opportunity to share and present our semester-long work:

> While my database backup system isn’t the flashiest feature, it sparked insightful conversations with parents and visitors who were curious about the foundation of our server architecture. I also received suggestions for potential real-world use cases I hadn’t considered before.
