## About Me
High School Junior with a passion for cybersecurity, computer science, and machine learning. I enjoy creating different personal projects especially regarding anything in machine learning. I've combined conventional machine models with LLM enchancements, and experimented with models in many different ways.

I enjoy working on the backend a lot. Throughout my time working on projects, my Java skills have been taken a notch up, my understanding of databases have gone up, and especially my debugging skills. 

## Project Overview
My database backup management is under the Database/UI group, which is in charge of managing the Database and the UI of the entire website. My specific feature allows the class to backup and restore the database to a previous feature. This is helpful when we need to perform a schema upgrade, in which we need to delete the database.


### Grade Analytics (Before December - December)
I started off CSA with the assignments group, helping debug and assist with the assignment creation. I became responsible for creating grade analytics. The grade analytics displays the average class scores on an assignment, and the individual grades that the user got. 
- I created the backend API points to calculate the summary statistics
- I created the frontend to take those summary statistics and graph them out

### Database Backups (December - Now)
My database backup management is under the Database/UI group, which is in charge of managing the Database and the UI of the entire website. My specific feature allows the class to backup and restore the database to a previous feature. This is helpful when we need to perform a schema upgrade, in which we need to delete the database.
- Created the API for the backups entirely by myself
- Created the frontend page mostly by myself (Lilian integrated my HTML page into ThymeLeaf)

### Bug Fixes (May)
I also fixed the issue of having to delete the database after every single run, by creating a script to switch from auto-ddl from "update" to "none" when needed:

## Data Structures Certification & Academic Excellence

### Certification Achievement
Throughout the six months I've worked on database, I've come to have a complex understanding on how databases work, and also how the different tables are composed for each group.

Complex understanding of SQLite Databases
- Operations in SQLite database --> (PUT EXAMPLE HERE)
- Different SQLite configurations (i.e WAL mode, delay)

Complex knowledge of Server Tables
- Because I had to work with all tables for this class, I have a comprehensive understanding of all tables.

## Project Showcasing Experience

### Night at the Museum (N@tM) - June 2025
Night at the Museum was an amazing opportunity to be able to share our work for the past months, receive feedback, and see what other students work as well. I received feedback on my project, and from presenting it received ideas about a new potential place for it to be used and adapted to that I hadnâ€™t considered before. 

Honestly, database backups wasn't the best feature to attract a crowd. Out of all the features in the class, it is probably the least marketable. However I did have a good time having discussions with parents that were willing to stand and listen to me explain how the database supports our entire server, and where my database backups plays into it.
