## **Introduction**

The AP Computer Science A exam includes four main types of Free Response Questions (FRQs):  

- **Methods and Control Structures**  
- **Class**  
- **Array/ArrayList**  
- **2D Array**  

Today, our focus is on attacking the **Classes FRQ**, which tests your understanding of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts. This includes:  
- Creating and manipulating **classes**  
- Writing **constructors**  
- Managing **instance variables**  
- Implementing **methods**  
- Understanding how objects **interact** in Java  



## **Getting the first 4 points on ANY Classes FRQ**

The key for tackling any classes frq, even if you don't know how to solve the problem, is to have the right 
1. **Instance Variables**  
   - Attributes of an object (e.g., `name`, `age`).  

2. **Constructors**  
   - Initialize objects and set instance variables.

3. **Methods**  
   - **Getters/Setters:** Access and alter instance variables.  
   - Perform actions or computations related to the object.

Remembering  to use the proper names, types, and encapsulations are key to getting these 4 points EASILY. Trystan will cover these in  more detail  in the prompt.
