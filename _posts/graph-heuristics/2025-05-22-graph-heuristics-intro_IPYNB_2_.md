## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, we will be able to:



* Define graph heuristics and explain their purpose
* Compare traditional algorithms with heuristic approaches
* Implement and analyze Greedy Best-First Search
* Understand the A* algorithm and its mathematical foundation
* Apply heuristics to solve real-world pathfinding problems

## **Introduction to Graph Heuristics**

Graph heuristics are **estimation-based strategies** used to solve graph problems efficiently when finding an exact solution would be computationally expensive or time-consuming. Unlike traditional algorithms that guarantee optimal solutions, heuristics prioritize speed and practicality by making educated guesses about the best path forward.


### **Key Concept: Heuristic = Estimation**

A heuristic function  estimates the cost or distance from a current state to the goal. It doesn't guarantee accuracy but provides a reasonable approximation to guide decision-making.


## **Real-World Applications**


### **GPS Navigation Systems**

When you request directions from point A to point B, your GPS doesn't examine every possible route (which could take hours for complex road networks). Instead, it uses heuristics to estimate which roads are most likely to lead to faster routes, considering factors like:



* Straight-line distance to destination
* Speed limits on different road types
* Historical traffic patterns


### **Social Network Analysis**

Platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn use graph heuristics to:



* Suggest friends based on mutual connections
* Group users into communities
* Recommend content based on network proximity


### **Task Scheduling and Project Management**

Project management software uses heuristics to:



* Organize task dependencies
* Estimate project completion times
* Allocate resources efficiently
