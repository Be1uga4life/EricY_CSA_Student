    "## 👨‍💻 About Me\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a high school junior with a passion for **cybersecurity**, **computer science**, and **machine learning**. I enjoy working on personal projects—especially those involving machine learning—where I’ve experimented with combining conventional models and large language model (LLM) enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "I focus heavily on backend development. Through my projects, I’ve sharpened my **Java skills**, deepened my **understanding of databases**, and significantly improved my **debugging abilities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💾 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I work in the `Database/UI` group, which manages both the backend database and the user interface of our website. My primary contribution has been a **database backup management system** that allows the class to **backup and restore** the database—critical for safe schema upgrades that require a full reset.\n",

    "### 📊 Grade Analytics (Before December – December)\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I joined the `Assignments` group and helped debug assignment creation. I eventually became responsible for developing a **Grade Analytics** feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created backend API endpoints to compute summary statistics\n",
    "- Built the frontend to display these stats as graphs\n",
